Not really happy with my notes about threads vs. processes, I feel like I haven't really captured kernel of things I'd need to say about them.


### 12:08pm 

The three main conceptual areas to revise: 
1. Processes (container/execution context), threads (unit of execution)
2. Concurrency (esp. how to program it safely)
3. Memory management + virtual memory
4. Syscalls (crossing the kernel/user boundary)

Some difficulty of the correspondence between the container/execution mental model I have, and the process/thread discusssion. 



### 12:17pm 
I think take a _short break_. Then come back and jot down a short list of the key concepts I'd want to be able to explain for processes/threads.
