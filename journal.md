Not really happy with my notes about threads vs. processes, I feel like I haven't really captured kernel of things I'd need to say about them.


### 12:08pm 

The three main conceptual areas to revise: 
1. Processes (container/execution context), threads (unit of execution)
2. Concurrency (esp. how to program it safely)
3. Memory management + virtual memory
4. Syscalls (crossing the kernel/user boundary)
